Schema:

  - Rational (fraction)
    - Floating point numerator
    - Integer denominator
  - Mixed fraction type
    - Rational with whole number (integer)

  - Project [DONE]
    - Assets (video, audio, generator resources)
      - UUID identifier (as key)
      - Type (audio, video, event list)
      - Source (file, generator, etc)
      - File path (if file)
      - Generator object (TODO, how to specify?)
      - Duration of asset (or recommended duration if generator)
    - Sequence(s) [DONE]
      - Track groupings [DONE]
        - Track groups to render [DONE]
      - Track group(s) (with track type Video, Audio, Event) [DONE]
        - Initial frame rate, interlace, aspect ratio, sample rate, etc. [DONE]
        - Track list (for display) by name [DONE]
        - Track group slice(s) [DONE]
          - Change frame rate, interlace, aspect ratio, sample rate, etc. for this slice [DONE]
            - Tracks by name [DONE]
              - Slices (media cuts, from a file, sequence, generator, etc) [DONE]
                - Slice start/end/duration in whole ticks only. Using floating point for map keys can open up a whole
                  can of worms regarding floating point precision. No thanks. [DONE]
                - Start time of a slice is unique. Multiple slices cannot start at the same time on the same track [DONE]
                - Slice overlap is allowed only if two slices that partially overlap. Multiple overlaps not allowed [DONE]
                - Slice envelope
                - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply to slices
                  - Envelope for each transformation
                - Overlap envelope (to apply if ONE previous slice overlaps this one)
                - Asset to render
                - Start time within asset to render (long double type for precision)
                - Playback speed (scalar against playback position after envelope)
              - Track envelope
              - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply to track
                - Envelope for each transformation
              - Mute, solo
              - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply at that level of the track composition
