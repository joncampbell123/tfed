Schema:

  - Project
    - Sequence(s)
      - Track group(s) (with track type Video, Audio, Event)
        - Initial frame rate, interlace, aspect ratio, sample rate, etc.
        - Tracks
          - Slices (media cuts, from a file, sequence, generator, etc)
            - Slice envelope
            - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply to slices
              - Envelope for each transformation
          - Track envelope
          - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply to track
            - Envelope for each transformation
          - Mute, solo
          - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply at that level of the track composition
        - Format change markers
          - Change frame rate, interlace, aspect ratio, sample rate, etc. at that immediate point including reset to track group
