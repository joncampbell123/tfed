Schema:

  - Rational (fraction)
    - Floating point numerator
    - Integer denominator
  - Mixed fraction type
    - Rational with whole number (integer)

  - Project
    - Sequence(s)
      - Track groupings
        - Track groups to render
      - Track group(s) (with track type Video, Audio, Event)
        - Initial frame rate, interlace, aspect ratio, sample rate, etc.
        - Track list (for display) by name
        - Track group slice(s)
          - Change frame rate, interlace, aspect ratio, sample rate, etc. for this slice
            - Tracks by name
              - Slices (media cuts, from a file, sequence, generator, etc)
                - Slice start/end/duration in whole ticks only. Using floating point for map keys can open up a whole
                  can of worms regarding floating point precision. No thanks.
                - Start time of a slice is unique. Multiple slices cannot start at the same time on the same track
                - Slice overlap is allowed only if two slices that partially overlap. Multiple overlaps not allowed
                - Slice envelope
                - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply to slices
                  - Envelope for each transformation
                - Overlap envelope (to apply if ONE previous slice overlaps this one)
              - Track envelope
              - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply to track
                - Envelope for each transformation
              - Mute, solo
              - Transformations/transitions/effects to apply at that level of the track composition

  - Envelope
    - Parameters
      - X, Y, scale width, scale height, scale w/h lock (X/Y as percent of frame)

      - Volume
      - Per-channel volume
      - Panning
      - Per-channel remap matrix
      - (more, depending on transformation)
      - (more, depending on generator)
      - Generator
    - Parameter entry
      - Interpolation mode to apply at that point forward
      - Entry is keyframe
      - Interpolation weight
